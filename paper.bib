  abstract = {Recently, a uniform approach was given [5] for different concepts

	matrix-type
	
	Pad'e approximants, such as descriptions of vector and matrix Pad'e
	
	approximants
	
	along with generalizations of simultaneous and Hermite Pad'e

	considerations in this paper are based on this generalized form of
	
	the classical scalar
	
	Hermite Pad'e approximation problem, power Hermite Pad'e
	
	approximation. In particular
	
	we study the problem of computing these new approximants.
	
	A recurrence relation is presented for the computation of a basis
	for
	
	the corresponding
	
	linear solution space of these approximants. This recurrence also
	
	provides
	
	bases for particular subproblems. This generalizes previous work by
	
	Van Barel and
	
	Bultheel and, in a more general form, by Beckermann. The computation
	
	of the

	straight-line program we give also relies on matrix product over K[x]

	We further show that all these problems can be solved in particular
